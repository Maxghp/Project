The beauty of one sister
who loved them so
she smuggled the woodlice
of digging in the yard,
& after the older ones of us
this is what she knew of love,
& the beloveds emerged one
by one from their defenses, unfolding
themselves across the bed’s white sheet
like they did over 400 years ago, carried
from that other moonlight,
accidentally, or by children, into
adapting to the new rooms
of cloths, then fields, & we,
the elders to that sister,
we, having seen strangers
we began, then, to teach her the lessons
of dirt & fear.
